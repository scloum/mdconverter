Deal summary

iA Financial group, one of the largest insurance & management groups in Canada, is on an aggressive modernization journey to stop managing data centers, simplify their data environment, and reduce costs. Their goal is to have the right technology that will allow them agility and speed to deliver value to their business. With Azure VMware Solution, the team ensured a faster migration and a smooth transition to the cloud in an environment they already understood. Deal highlights 3-year $91M MACC

Sales team Commercial Executive: Edwin Vergara Account Executive: Antoine Lebrun New Commerce FastTrack PM: Chris Goodlette Deal Desk: Sarah Andersen And many more... Key advantages of MCA-E Cost management and allocation: The Cost Management blade within the Azure portal is much more robust than in EA and gives the customer the ability to analyze their costs and make more impactful data-based business decisions.  iA also gains the capability to receive customer-specific advice and recommendations on cost savings based on their specific usage. Billing profiles and invoice sections: The New Commerce FastTrack team (NCF) successfully implemented a system that allows iA to structure their account using distinct billing profiles and invoice sections. This streamlined the organization’s costs, billing information, and payment methods within and across multiple invoice sections, enhancing overall financial management, including chargebacks. Simplified digital purchasing experience: Even with a fully digital and simplified purchase experience, iA was able to negotiate multiple discounts and the custom terms most important to them.
