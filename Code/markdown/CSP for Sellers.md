# Partners may drive CSP deals for managed customer accounts
What should you do in this case? Determine if the customer wants or needs partner expertise for their particular business need scenario, using the cloud services purchasing guidance resources. Determine if the customer requires Microsoft support directly in the particular scenario, using the cloud services purchasing guidance resources. Develop trust with partners that we’re all acting in the customer's best interest, to ensure customer needs are met, and they realize value of their investment both now and in the future. Understand and respect partner incumbency – where there are partners working with customers, explore those relationships and work with these partners first before introducing new partners. Respect customer choices when it comes to partners they work with. If customers are looking for additional or different partners, work closely with the customer to identify other potential partners. Understand the landscape of partners in your industries, your customer ecosystem, and your geography in order to get the most from that partner network. Keep your understanding fresh and current. Understand whether the Cloud Solution Provider purchasing option capabilities fulfill your customer needs.

What should you know? Purchasing through CSP is an appropriate option for a managed account whose needs can be met by the partner. Partners drive growth, no matter how a customer decides to purchase. As a Microsoft seller, you can meet your revenue and consumption goals with CSP deals.

# Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) sales scenarios covered
Click on the scenario to go directly to that page New CSP deal being pitched by a partner to an EA customer Upsell/cross-sell into customer who has purchased via CSP New workload or product/service opportunity for existing CSP customer, but current partner does not support this workload or product/service New workload or product/service opportunity for existing CSP customer, and partner does support the solution Customer has an upcoming EA renewal Customer moves from EA to CSP and has product or licensing support needs Customer needs to change from current partner to another partner selling through CSP Customer wants to migrate from CSP to EA or an MCA through their account team (direct markets)

<!-- Slide number: 4 -->
# Scenario 1
New CSP deal being pitched by a partner to an EA customer What should the seller do? Best Practice: If the seller and the partner are both engaged with the customer for the same deal, work with the partner to co-sell if possible. Share the lead with partner. (Scenario may differ if the customer is already working with a preferred partner or does not yet have a partner. If a partner referral is needed, provide three or more partners, following standard practices). If the partner is driving the CSP deal and they don’t need any support from you, let the partner lead the sales engagement. In this scenario, or if the partner reaches out for help: Understand customer needs and how they can be met by either the enterprise motion or the breadth motion Work with the partner on value solutions selling to customer Understand whether the partner currently has an engagement with this customer for a managed service With the partner, identify what will drive growth with the customer Ensure the customer is educated objectively on their purchasing options. If the customer requests, create a deal in enterprise motion and allow the customer to make their choice. Use empowerment in compete and upsell scenarios as needed but do not offer concessions to compete against other purchasing motions.

What should the seller mindset be? Purchasing through CSP is an appropriate option for a managed account whose needs can be met through the partner. Partners have roles to play in both the breadth motion and in the enterprise motion. Partners can drive growth in both scenarios.

What does the partner do? Craft the deal, set pricing, negotiate with customer. Best practices: Share deal leads in Partner Center with Microsoft account teams Help customer understand CSP purchasing capabilities and limitations, such as customer use of Premier or Unified Support for Cloud Solution Provider purchases

<!-- Slide number: 5 -->
# Scenario 2
Upsell/cross-sell into customer who has purchased via CSP What should the seller do? Best Practice: Seek opportunities to work with the partner on value solutions selling to the customer. Understand if the partner has capabilities to drive and deliver other workloads (e.g., biz apps, data, security). Involve the partner in all customer conversations to ensure you and the partner are aligned on customer needs and can jointly drive co-sell. With the partner, identify what will drive growth with the customer. Check customer licensing footprint in customer work area in Partner Center to identify cross-sell/upsell opportunities – determine if they are working with a partner. (The CSP section of customer work area is not yet complete, so license purchases won’t show for purchases made.) Check both the Customer Management Agent Tool (CMAT) and the Azure Commercial Services Tool (CST) for Cloud Solution Provider purchases. Check in MSX to see if there are partners sharing leads for upsell/cross-sell. SMC sellers: Use Daily Recommender to identify opportunities plus partner MSX pre-loads. Identify/introduce to the partner proof of concept Microsoft-funded programs where available for those partners (such as Fast Track, Azure proof of concept credits, etc.).

What should the seller mindset be? You can help partners upsell/cross-sell in managed accounts with the CSP program—partners will reach out when they want help. What does the partner do? Identify new workloads, new solutions, or upsell opportunities to premium offers such as Microsoft 365 E5. Drive upsell opportunities and engage the Microsoft account team where needed if partner needs help. Best practice: Share lead with Microsoft as co-sell lead with no help needed

# Scenario 3
New workload or product/service opportunity for existing CSP customer, but current partner does not support this workload or product/service What should the seller do? If the customer tells you their needs cannot be met by the current partner, confirm with the partner that they cannot or will not support. Once confirmed, treat it as a net new opportunity. Share this opportunity with qualified partners as in-bound or out-bound to formalize the co-sell. Select the solution and share this with the partners. Define customer needs, then apply guidance to identify purchasing options for customer: Understand customer needs and how they can be met by different purchasing options With the partner, identify what will drive growth with the customer Work with the partner on value solutions selling to the customer Help find and bring in partner that can assist with this new workload or product/service If the customer elects not to work with a partner, transact the purchase with the customer yourself through the Microsoft Customer Agreement, EA, or online

What should the seller mindset be? Be transparent with the partner about customer needs and why customer might seek alternative purchasing options or partner. What does the partner do? Through the commercial marketplace, a partner can sell another partner’s IP. A partner can bring in a deal and add other partners to it  with or without the Microsoft seller involved. See instructions here:  Manage co-sell opportunities - Partner Center | Microsoft Docs Co-sell raining materials for field can be found at aka.ms/cosellhub

# Scenario 4
New workload or product/service opportunity for existing CSP customer, and partner does support the solution What should the seller do? Assuming you have visibility into this scenario, you should: Confirm with the customer that they wish to continue working with same partner; support this approach assuming their needs can be met If needs can’t be met by the current partner, treat it as a net new opportunity Share this opportunity with qualified partner as in-bound or out-bound to formalize the co-sell. Select the solution and share this with the partner

What should the seller mindset be? Be transparent with the  partner about customer needs and why customer might seek alternative purchasing options or partner. What does the partner do? Provide the solution for the customer. Best practice: Share lead with Microsoft as co-sell lead with no help needed

# Scenario 5
Customer has an upcoming EA renewal What should the seller do? Define customer needs, then apply guidance to identify purchasing options for customer using the cloud services purchasing guidance resources. If the customer wants to purchase via the Enterprise Agreement, work with partner on the EA renewal. The customer may wish to purchase cloud services through their seller under the Microsoft Customer Agreement. In that case, develop the deal and proposal. Work with the customer to identify partners who can support deployment, management, and other aspects of the customer’s environment. (Direct markets only) If the customer wants to purchase through a Microsoft partner, work with the partner and the customer. If the customer wants to purchase from a new partner, engage in outbound sharing of renewal opportunities. If the customer chooses to purchase through a partner, engage the customer’s partner(s), or refer to partners qualified to fulfill customer needs.

What does the partner do? Define customer needs, then apply guidance to identify purchasing options for customer. Work with Microsoft account team on renewal. What should the seller mindset be? Objectively outline the purchasing options. Let the customer decide on direction and optimum way to renew (EA, buying through their sales team, or buying from a CSP partner). Any renewal, whether through EA or through a CSP partner, is considered a win.

# Scenario 6
Customer moves from EA to CSP and has product or licensing support needs What should the seller do? Understand what the customer has purchased through the partner, and direct customer support needs to the partner. Look in the customer work area in Partner Center to see what the managed customer has purchased from the partner. Connect your customer with the partner that needs to provide the support. Align customer expectations on support differences between buying through their EA, the sales team under the MCA (direct markets only), and through a CSP partner. Make sure the customer is aware that with in purchasing from a CSP partner, the customer will not be able to use or purchase Unified or Premier Support contract with Microsoft for purchases made through CSP. (This needs to happen before the purchase takes place – post-sales is a more reactive reminder). Do not sell Unified or Premier Support contract to customers on services or products they buy through a CSP partner. What should the seller mindset be? The Microsoft account team is always available to discuss solutions, no matter how the customer makes purchases. The Microsoft Client Executive is on point to manage the customer, no matter how the customer purchases. What does the partner do? Provide front-line customer support for workloads and products/services purchased through CSP, including technical, billing, and licensing support. Ensure customer is aware of the following: They will not be able to use or purchase Unified or Premier Support for purchases covered under Cloud Solution Provider. If moving to purchase through a partner, carefully consider renewal of Premier contracts. Transition from one purchasing option to another may require technical migration, potential downtime, need to cancel and re-buy, or other considerations

# Scenario 7
Customer needs to change from current partner to another partner selling through CSP What should the seller do? Direct the customer to their current or future partner to get the information needed to perform the process. Provide partner options under standard process described here: https://aka.ms/SMC-CPartnerReferralGuidance You will not play significant role in execution.

What should the seller mindset be? This is a choice between the customer and partners—don’t attempt to play a significant operational role here. What does the partner do? Partner to partner transition in CSP is supported by tools for Azure customers on new commerce. Contact support to help with the transition if transition tools do not exist.

<!-- Slide number: 11 -->
# Scenario 8
Customer wants to migrate from CSP to EA or an MCA through their account team (direct markets) What should the seller do? Work with the customer and the partner to figure out what we need to do to keep the customer happy in the breadth motion. Be aware that no tooling exists to support transitions from breadth to enterprise. Review the Azure Transition Policy and Guidance document Pursuing this will result in manual work for the customer, partner, and Microsoft, and will involve significant cost and effort This change may negatively impact long term customer and partner satisfaction Understand and document the key drivers for the requested change The customer should inform their partner that they are looking for this change. Don’t communicate this to the partner on the customer’s behalf Work with the Partner Development Manager (PDM) to identify issues, if there is a PDM assigned to this partner. Use the OCP Insights tool to identify the PDM: OCP Insights (microsoft.com) Refer partners as required

What should the seller mindset be? Moving from breadth should be a last resort. There are implications including cost, time, and resources associated with moving from the breadth to the enterprise motion. There will also be changes associated with how the customer gets technical, product, and licensing support. Any change of this nature should be driven ONLY by the customer, based on a need that cannot be met or a customer purchasing decision that necessitates a change. This move should never be initiated by the Microsoft account team to meet internal goals. What does the partner do? The current partner should work with customer to figure out what they need to do to keep the customer happy in the breadth motion. If a move is required, help support the customer transition with the Microsoft seller.
