Volume Licensing SKU Naming Improvements

Frequently asked questions for field

Last updated 8 July 2021

Last modified 22 April 2020

Overview As part of the pursuit of simplicity and clarity in our commerce processes and systems, we’re changing the name formatting of product families (PFAMs) and stock-keeping units (SKUs) to allow for more readable descriptions to help with creating accurate proposals and orders, tracking entitlements and usage, and improving the billing and invoicing process. This project addresses a key pain point for customers, partners, and internal sellers and ensures updated descriptions align with actual attribution of the products.

Q & A Why is this being done now?

We’re doing this to address feedback from customers, partners, and field sellers. The SKU naming has been a consistent pain point as we collect feedback on volume licensing to make improvements. Now, we have the resources to address this feedback and decrease SKU complexity around SKU naming. Our goal is to simplify the descriptions and to improve the ease of doing business with Microsoft.

What is the timing of this and what should I expect?

-  As of February 2021, net new volume licensing product descriptions and SKUs began using

the new product descriptions.

-  Starting 1 September 2021 volume licensing pricelists, you’ll see in-market SKU descriptions
on pricelists with more obvious descriptions of the products and versions. Note that SKU numbers will remain the same.

Additional readiness and details regarding the change will be published with advanced notice.

Will SKU numbers change?

No, SKU numbers will not change. They will remain the same.

How can I find a SKU number in VLSC?

Navigate to the “Licenses” drop-down and select “License Summary”, then click “Order Confirmations”.  A list of all the POs invoiced for your company will appear; you can click on any

Frequently asked questions for field

PO and it will display the invoice details for that PO, including the sku number and current (new) sku description.

What will the new SKU descriptions look like?

For example, a SKU description for the “Dynamics 365 Plan - Operations Additional File Storage (Qualified Offer) for Faculty” might go from this:

-  PowerAppsPortalLoginCapT2 ShrdSvr ALNG SubsVL MVL Addon Min10Units100logins

To, for example, this:

-  Power Apps Portal Login Cap T2 Sub Add-on Min 10 Units 100 Logins

How will this affect the pricelist?

No, this will not affect the pricelist in terms of how you consume or access it.  Product descriptions on the pricelist will look better but functionality won’t change.

Are the impacted changes affecting all the products?

No, the scope of this project includes only volume licensing.  This does not include retail, devices, OEM, CSP, MPSA or Azure.  Alignment across naming will occur where possible, but each line of business and market strategy has differing requirements.

Will other Microsoft platforms be impacted?

Yes, the changing of the SKUs happens at the very source of the data and that data source flows to all the downstream systems. When we change at the source, they will be reflecting in all those tools that are accessible internally and externally. Once the changes take place, all systems will be consistent with the change, and it will be updated on previous purchases as well.

Volume Licensing SKU Naming Improvements

Frequently asked questions for field

How do I map the old SKU descriptions to the new descriptions?

SKU numbers will not change, as this project is changing the item name, otherwise known as SKU description. You will be able to map changes by cross-referencing the SKU number.  A Volume Licensing SKU Change Management Tool is available here (coming  September 2021).

Who is responsible for making sure the new PFAM and SKU descriptions are consistent?

This is a cross-collaborative effort during each step of the process, including business planning, finance, operations, product marketing, and commercial licensing.

What approach are you taking to address specific country and contractual requirements, especially those for government customers?

There is an assessment being completed to track the countries and customers that have this requirement and address those needs. Some government Framework agreements do include a statement that SKU descriptions may change at any time.

Who can I talk to if I have a question or issue with the new SKU naming improvements?

Internal corporate teams and field sellers can follow their normal escalation paths. Partners should engage their partner development managers.

How will customers be notified of these changes?

Customer will receive a communication about this change on Friday, August 13, 2021. They will be encouraged to work with their partners if there are any questions.

How will partners be notified of these changes?

Volume Licensing Partners will be notified of these changes in the Weekly Operations News Summary beginning in July 2021. Additionally, Partners will be able join the August Enterprise Community Call. For self-serve readiness material on this topic, Partners can also visit the Operations Readiness (microsoft.com) site and search Product Description Optimization.

Where will the changes impact our operational procedures for the field and partners?

-  Changes will be made at the source of the data and will be updated to the new value the

first of each month.

o  Due to the number of impacted systems in the data flow, some systems will be

updated with the new names before our pricelists.
