# **How does subscription end date cotermination work for MCA-E Software Subscriptions?**

Coterminosity is the ability to align the start and/or end dates of different subscriptions within a proposal or a customer account. At launch, it won’t be available for MCA-E Software Subscriptions, but it is planned for August 2025 and will be the same structure as current per user offers purchased through the MCA-E.

# **If Buy Online is out of scope, will these all be hidden offers in MCA-E so they aren’t on the Buy Online product catalog?**

All the Software Subscriptions are being implemented as hidden offers on MCA-E. Hidden offers are available to add to a proposal through MCA-E, but hidden from Buy Online.

# **Can I move my customers who currently transact their Software Subscriptions via a SCE to purchase through MCA-E instead?**

Yes, customers who are currently transacting Windows Server, SQL Server, and Systems Center via the SCE will be able to transact instead through an MCA-E seller proposal after launch.

# **Will CIS Suite be available through the MCA-E?**

CIS Suite will not be available on MCA-E at launch but is expected to launch in the future. Until CIS Suite is launched, CIS Suite customers can still migrate to MCA-E by adding the standalone components (Windows Server and System Center) to the proposal.

# **Are there any prerequisites for buying Software Subscriptions through MCA-E?**

The customer must sign the Microsoft Customer Agreement before transacting.

# **Is there any policy or empowerment around buying Software Subscriptions through MCA-E?**

Discount empowerment will follow the policy laid out in [Empowerment Guide 2927](https://empguide.trafficmanager.net/concession/2927).

# **Is price protection available for Software Subscriptions through MCA-E?**

Price protection will not be a part of the initial launch but is planned to launch November 2025 as part of the “adding additional licenses” and “True Ups” additional features.

# **Where can pricing for MCA-E Software Subscription be viewed?**

# Where to view pricing for MCA-E Windows Server, SQL Server, and System Center will vary before and after the delivery of the pricelist tool in Proposals in MSX.

# Before December 2025: Navigate to the CSP Software Price List, Choose the current month folder, Download the pricelist for the relevant country code (e.g. US for USD prices), Refer to the ERP field in the chosen price list. MCA-E server subscription list prices are consistent with CSP ERP price.

# After December 2025: Software prices are expected to be added to the pricelist tool in Proposals in MSX in December 2025, Navigate to MSX Price List, Choose “Software products” in the drop down, Click “Download pricelist without search” or search individual server subscription SKUs

# **Where can customers view pricing for MCA-E Software Subscriptions?**

For the initial launch, customers will not be able to purchase units through the MAC (but this capability is expected in CY2026). As such, customers will not be able to view pricing in the MAC either.

# **Are the same discount types available for Software Subscriptions as for per user offers (one-time, future, list price, renewal)?**

Only one-time discounts are available in the initial launch via the policy laid out in [Empowerment Guide 2927](https://empguide.trafficmanager.net/concession/2927). Additional discount types may be added in the future.

# **Will there be special pricing or a promotion for customers moving their Software Subscriptions from an EA to the MCA-E?**

No.

# **When will on-premises software be available through MCA-E?**

This launch lays the foundation for annuity software in MCA-E and prepares us for future launches, when we will expand the software catalog and capabilities to enable full EA customer migration to MCA-E.

# **Why are specific versions listed in the catalog? Is the purchase just for a specific version or will customers be entitled to upgrade to the newest version of the product if new versions are released?**

Even though the MCA-E product catalog lists software subscriptions with the latest subscription version, the purchase is “version-less.” MCA-E Software Subscriptions purchases include New Version Rights which fulfill new versions automatically upon release. In the MCA-E product catalog, it is necessary to list the latest version so the new commerce fulfillment system can make the correct versions available for customers in Admin Center.

# **Which Software Assurance (SA) benefits are included with Software Subscriptions through MCA-E?**

One-year and three-year subscriptions for SQL Server, System Center, and Windows Server (including CALs, Remote Desktop Services, and Rights Management Services) provide most rights similar to traditional SA benefits. However, new commerce Software Subscriptions do not include License Mobility rights.

# **How will customers manage their Software Subscriptions?**

Once a customer accept a proposal, customers will be able to view and manage the subscriptions through the Microsoft 365 admin center (MAC).

# **What steps are required to grant end users permission to access the licenses?**

Unlike Per User licenses, Software licenses are not assigned to a specific user and do not need to be assigned. Server licenses are for server cores, not for users. In the Microsoft 365 Admin Center (MAC), tenant admins navigate to the "Your Products" page and click on the relevant Software Subscription, which will return flyout information that has the software download and the key if needed.

# **Can the tenant admin provide end users with access to the product download and keys or can only the tenant admin access them?**

# Key and downloads are fulfilled from the Microsoft 365 Admin Center (MAC), the users of the MAC would need to be given admin roles in the tenant to be able to access the download and keys. Tenant admins are requested to obtain the software from the MAC and distribute it to end users. This model is consistent with legacy methodology where in the Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC), IT admins obtained the software and distributed it to the end users.

# **If a customer initially buys a software subscription through a seller and the MCA-E process, can they add to or change the subscription on their own in MAC?**

For the initial launch, customers will not be able to purchase units through the MAC, but this feature will be added in the next project phase, expected CY2026. Cancellations will not be allowed self-serve in MAC for products acquired via a seller proposal, consistent with MCA-E cancellation policy. Customers should work with their seller and Microsoft customer support if a cancellation is requested.

# **Can a customer upgrade a software subscription through the MAC?**

This feature will come in the next project phase.

# **If a non-ISV SPLA partner wants to buy through MCA-E and not CSP Hoster, will that be allowed?**

Microsoft sales teams will be qualifying customers and determining which customers will be managed through MCA-E.

# **Will there be any changes to Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) with the launch of Software Subscriptions in MCA-E?**

There are currently no changes planned for Software Subscriptions through Cloud Solution Provider partners, but enhancements to CSP Software Subscriptions will be part of a future release.
